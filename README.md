# collatz_conjecture
I've made this to practice my skills in Python. The "Collatz Conjecture" is taking a number and dividing it by 2 or multiplying it by 3 and adding 1 if it's odd. This script does this to every number from 1 to infinity and stores the highest number of "iterations" or calculations done on a number as in dividing, multiplying and adding.

I've also added a "save" feature. It saves the current number and highest iterations to a .txt file so it can continue where it left off. This only works if you terminate the script by CTRL+C though.
